             I'm a cybersecurity researcher and low-level systems developer with a focus on ethical hacking, darknet technologies, and decentralized architectures. As leader of the Null Cybersecurity Community and head of the Wipro Centre of Excellence, I design and build tools that push the limits of privacy, security, and system design â€” from custom crawlers to in-memory exploits. I thrive at the edge of innovation and control.
